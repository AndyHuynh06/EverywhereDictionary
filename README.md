# EverywhereDictionary
Highlight a word, then click (control + alt)  or your custom shortcut to open the dictionary of the word you highlighted. You can now translate word from everywhere. This is just a very basic application, if you have any suggestion for improvement, feel to do so. Thank you!

This is extremely useful for me, personally!
